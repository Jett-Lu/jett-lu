  <strong>About Me</strong><br>
</p>

```text
I'm a software engineering student with a focus on automation, infrastructure, and clean systems design.
I enjoy building tools that are practical, reliable, and easy to maintain — from scripts that speed up dev workflows
to platforms that scale with users.

My interests span DevOps, accessibility, embedded systems, and cybersecurity. 
I value readable code, meaningful abstractions, and solving the right problems.
